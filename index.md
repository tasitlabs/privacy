# Tasit Privacy Policy

_Last updated April 10, 2019_

We are delighted that you have chosen to use one of our apps and/or visit our website. We take our data protection responsibilities with the utmost seriousness and we have designed our website so that you may navigate and use our website without having to provide Personal Data.

This Policy sets out what Personal Data we collect, how we process it and how long we retain it. This Policy applies to all of our processing activities where we act as a data controller. In this policy, "we", "us" and "our" refers to Tasit Labs, Inc. a company incorporated in the state of Delaware in the United States of America. For more information about us, see the Contact Us section of this policy.

In this Policy, “personal data” means any information relating to you as an identified or identifiable natural person (“Data Subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

In this Policy, “processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data (as defined in this Privacy Policy) or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

### 2. Your information and the Blockchain

Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply ‘DLT’), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called ‘blocks’. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several ‘nodes’ which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.

Accordingly, by design, a blockchain's records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be ‘immutable’. This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’), or your rights to object or restrict processing, of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens) it will be necessary to write certain personal data, such as your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.

In most cases ultimate decisions to (i) transact on the blockchain using your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency wallet address, as well as (ii) share the public key relating to your Ethereum or other cryptocurrency address with anyone (including us) rests with you.

**IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE**

### 3. How We Use Personal Data

##### 3.1. When visiting our website

We may collect and process Personal Data about your use of our website. This data may include:

  Behaviour: subpage, duration, and revisit;
- The date and time of access to our website;
- The Internet protocol address (“IP address”);
- The Internet service provider of the accessing system; and
- Any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.

This data may be processed in order to deliver the content of our website correctly, to optimize the content of our website to ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate business interests, namely monitoring and improving our website and the proper protection of our business against risks and your consent when agreeing to accept cookies.

##### 3.2. When using any of the Tasit apps

a) On the Ethereum blockchain the following data will be stored:

- Your in-app ephemeral account address;
- Your smart contract address;
- Addresses of externally owned accounts;
- Transactions made with the app; and
- ETH and token balances.

The data is needed to create the user’s contract account if desired and to enable the user to make use of the app. The Tasit apps support multi-signature functionality in some cases. Thus, the externally owned accounts are needed to confirm a transaction before they are executed.

The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you.

The data will be stored on the Ethereum Blockchain. Given the technological design of the blockchain, as explained in section 2, this data will become public and it will not likely be possible to delete or change the data at any given time.

b) In our servers hosted on the cloud with Amazon Web Services we may opt to store the following data:

- Your in-app ephemeral address if applicable;
- Your smart contract address if applicable;
- Addresses of externally-owned accounts; and
- Transactions made in the app.

The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you.

c) Log Data

- Your in-app ephemeral address if applicable;
- Your smart contract address if applicable;
- Transaction id / Hash; and
- The Internet protocol address (“IP address”) if useful.

We maybe need this data to be able to debug issues and provide support for our application. The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you.

##### 3.3. When Participating in User Experience Research (UXR)

When you participate in our user experience research we may collect and process some personal data. This data may include:

You have certain rights under applicable legislation, and in particular under Regulation EU 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or ‘GDPR’). We explain these below. You can find out more about the GDPR and your rights by accessing the European Commission’s website.

##### Right to information and access

You have a right to be informed about the processing of your personal data (and if you did not give it to us, information as to the source) and this Privacy Policy intends to provide the information. Of course, if you have any further questions you can contact us regarding the above details.

##### Right to rectification

You have the right to have any inaccurate personal information about you rectified and to have any incomplete personal information about you completed. You may also request that we restrict the processing of that information. The accuracy of your information is important to us.

- you withdraw your consent to consent-based processing and no other legal justification for processing applies;
- you object to processing for direct marketing purposes;
- we unlawfully processed your personal information; and
- erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation that applies to us.

**However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your personal data is deleted. This is because the blockchain is a public decentralized network and blockchain technology does not generally allow for data to be deleted and your right to erasure may not be able to be fully enforced. In these circumstances we will only be able to ensure that all personal data that is held by us is permanently deleted.**

We will proceed to comply with an erasure request without delay unless continued retention is necessary for:

- Exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
- Complying with a legal obligation under US, EU, or other applicable law;
- The performance of a task carried out in the public interest;
- Archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, under certain circumstances; and/or
- The establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

##### Right to restrict processing and right to object to processing

You have a right to restrict processing of your personal information, such as where:

- You contest the accuracy of the personal information;
- Where processing is unlawful you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of the unlawfully processed personal information;
- We no longer need to process your personal information but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

You also have the right to object to processing of your personal information under certain circumstances, such as where the processing is based on your consent and you withdraw that consent. This may impact the services we can provide and we will explain this to you if you decide to exercise this right.

**However, when interacting with the blockchain, as it is a public decentralized network, we will not be able to prevent external parties from processing any personal data which has been written onto the blockchain. In these circumstances we will use our reasonable endeavors to ensure that all processing of personal data held by us is restricted, notwithstanding this, your right to restrict to processing may not be able to be fully enforced.**

##### Right to data portability

Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you have a right to receive the personal information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another person.

##### Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)

You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us. We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless:
